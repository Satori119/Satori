Satori: Building a Parallel Life in Japan

Satori is dedicated to constructing a two-way value network connecting digital minds with the physical world, offering global users a gateway to a "Parallel Life in Japan." More than just an AI companion app, it is an ecosystem that transforms emotional bonds into tangible reality.

Within the Satori ecosystem, users establish a deep "Twin-Star" relationship with a native Japanese AI. The platform features a unique "Day/Night" cycle: during the day, powered by decentralized compute, the AI autonomously explores real-world Japanese landmarks, sending back immersive travel postcards and diaries; at night, the AI returns home for intimate interactions and life sharing.

This emotional connection extends beyond the screen. The "souvenirs" and cultural experiences brought back by the AI create a seamless mapping between virtual sentiment and physical value, giving digital interactions a tangible weight. As the bond deepens, the system assetizes this relationship by granting users "Digital Residency," bridging online companionship with Real-World Assets (RWA) and offline benefits.

The Satori project is currently under active development. Details regarding our upcoming Miner Testnet nodes will be announced in due course.
